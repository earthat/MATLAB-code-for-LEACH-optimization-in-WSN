# MATLAB-code-for-LEACH-optimization-in-WSN
This MATLAB code improves the LEACH protocol for energy consumption minimization in WSN. The objective function for the LEACH optimization which can be used for any optimization algorithm is shared here. For detail and use example, you can visit https://free-thesis.com/product/modified-leach-protocol-with-gwo-optimization-in-wsn/.

## Highlights
- selected LEACH (Low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy) scheme for the minimization of energy consumption.
- GWO optimization algorithm is used to minimize the LEACH protocol objective function as written in shared code here.
- Initialized the random position of the grey wolves in GWO algorithm with limits equal to cluster head formation.
- The energy consumption of the sensor node is minimized by GWO optimized LEACH environment.
